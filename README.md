# LED_Desk_Light
Motion activated desk light. Built for rudimentary demonstration of human machine interaction interface


Used Arduino Micro with HC-SR501 PIR Motion sensors. Next, preference-based-learning is proposed to incorporate user-preferences to produce a more personalized actuator. This project will be used to demonstrate this concept with the LED bar acting as a lone actuator.
